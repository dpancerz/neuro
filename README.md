Naive Neural Network implementation.
Works on default Java's processing unit.

To implement a concrete neural network you have to provide a training set, test set, and bi-converters between double[]s and training item.
Two (basically the same) examples provided using regular strings as input:

static final String A =

                " @@ "
              + "@  @"
              + "@  @"
              + "@@@@"
              + "@  @"
              + "@  @";

TODO- implement adapter to keras-like interface for easier creation.
